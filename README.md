Features:
Automated Comment Extraction: The scraper automates the process of accessing YouTube video pages and extracting comments and replies.
Handling Pagination: Pagination of comments is handled dynamically, ensuring all comments and replies are captured.
Data Storage: Extracted comments and replies are stored in a structured format, facilitating further analysis and processing.
How to Use:
Set Up Environment: Ensure you have Python and Selenium installed in your environment.
Configure WebDriver: Set up a compatible WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) for your preferred browser.
Run the Script: Execute the script and provide the URL of the YouTube video from which you want to extract comments.
